# Personal Finance Management App :money_with_wings: :moneybag:

## Functionality Overview
 The purpose of this app is to help users organize and track their finances.
 <li>Users can create 
 checking (or main) accounts which can have subaccounts for savings and investments (savings account and investment accounts).</li>
 <br>
  <li>Users can create budgets. Budgets help users with tracking their expenses. Each budget is connected to one or more
 categories. Transactions which are assigned one of these categories count for that budget.
<br><br>
<i>For example: We can have a budget 'Food' of 500 which has two categories assigned to it - 'eating out' and 'grocery'. Now, if a transaction
is made with one of the categories, it will count as an expense for that budget.</i>
<br> <br>
 Once a user exceeds the limit of the budget (for example spends more than 500 on food), a
warning message will appear.
<br><br>
 Each budget has a period for which it is valid. The different types of periods are
`ANNUALY` ,`WEEKLY`, `MONTHLY` and `QUARTERLY`.
